# brazilian_e-commerce_analysis

## Overview
This project is a complete **end-to-end data analytics case study** based on the [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).  
The goal is to demonstrate the workflow from **raw data → cleaned data → data warehouse modeling → business intelligence dashboard**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: data cleaning, missing value imputation, exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **PostgreSQL**: database design with `staging` schema (raw tables) and `dwh` schema (fact/dimension tables, aggregates).
- **Tableau**: final business intelligence dashboards (KPIs, trends, customer behavior, delivery performance).

## Objectives
- Analyze sales dynamics and revenue growth
- Identify top-performing product categories and customer regions
- Evaluate logistics: delivery time, SLA performance, % of late orders
- Assess customer satisfaction (review scores) and its relation to delivery
- Measure customer loyalty (repeat rate, average order value)
